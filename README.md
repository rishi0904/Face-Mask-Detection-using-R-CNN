# Face-Mask-Detection-using-R-CNN

**DEVELOPED PROJECT UNDER COGNITEL SERVICES & PROVIDED DATASET**
- This Deep Convolutional Model based on R-CNN trained using Transfer Learning with around 800 data points successfully detects multiple
faces and classifies it ”With Mask” or ”Without Mask”.
- The accuracy metric used ”Average Precision” shows more than 90% score .
